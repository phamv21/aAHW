Overview
We'll decompose the Asteroids game into the following classes/sourcefiles. All of the following will be located in the src directory which we will talk about in a moment:

Util (src/utils.js)
Utility code, especially vector math stuff.
MovingObject (src/moving_object.js)
Base class for anything that moves.
Most important methods are MovingObject.prototype.move, MovingObject.prototype.draw(ctx), MovingObject.prototype.isCollidedWith(otherMovingObject).
Asteroid (src/asteroid.js)
Spacerock. It inherits from MovingObject.
Bullet (src/bullet.js)
Kill spacerocks with this. Also a MovingObject subclass.
Ship (src/ship.js)
This is you! Another MovingObject subclass.
Game (src/game.js)
ss
Keeps track of dimensions of the space; wraps objects around when they drift off the screen.
GameView (src/game_view.js)
Stores a Game instance.
Stores a canvas context to draw the game into.
Installs key listeners to move the ship and fire bullets.
Installs a timer to call Game.prototype.step.
Important Note Regarding ES6
Do not use ES6 class syntax in this project. Understanding prototypal inheritance is a main focus of today's project. Because ES6 class syntax obscures how prototypal inheritance works, and has some incompatibilities with the instructions below, avoid using it while working today. Ask your TA for a more nuanced explanation of this if you need more information.

A Refresher on Vectors
You'll use a lot of vectors in this assignment.

2D vectors have an x and a y component. A position vector has an x and y position, while a velocity vector has a speed in the x and the y directions.

Distance
To find the "distance" between two points, the formula is:

// this is math, not JavaScript
Dist([x_1, y_1], [x_2, y_2]) = sqrt((x_1 - x_2) ** 2 + (y_1 - y_2) ** 2)
Norm
A vector has a norm, a.k.a. magnitude or length. The norm of a velocity vector is a speed. If obj.vel = [3, 4] (3 horizontal pixels and 4 vertical pixels per unit time) then the overall speed is 5 pixels per unit time. You can easily calculate the norm of a vector using your distance function:

Norm([x_1, y_1]) = Dist([0, 0], [x_1, y_1])
Phase 0: index.html
We'll start by creating a directory named dist. Inside this dist directory we'll create an index.html file for your game to run in. In the body of this file, add a <canvas id="game-canvas"> tag with sensible default width and height properties. Open your index.html in your browser and use the browser's JavaScript console to test your code as you go.

Phase 1: index.js ( your entry point file for webpack and all your javascript )
As stated in the Overview, you will create classes and objects in different files and they will need to interact with one another. When using Javascript in the browser there is no standard, native way to have one file require another. Webpack will allow us to use require and module.exports syntax to import and export our classes and objects from different files.

Let's start by making sure our computer has webpack and webpack-cli installed globally by running npm install -g webpack webpack-cli. In the future we will create more specific configurations for webpack - but this will work just fine for your work on today's project. Webpack follows some common conventions that we will follow to ensure webpack is able to locate our entry file. To do this you'll make a src directory on the top level of our file tree (same level as the dist directory). Within the src directory create a index.js file (this will be webpack's entry point). Make sure your file set up matches src/index.js exactly (naming matters for webpack).

index.js will serve as the entry file for your project. Running webpack --watch --mode=development in your terminal will create a dist/main.js file for you that loads your index.js file, any files index.js requires, and any files that those files require! Webpack also doesn't add anything to the window without you explicitly declaring it.

Once you've run your webpack command you should be able to locate your dist/main.js file and add it in a script tag to your index.html below your canvas element (we'll come back to this point later).

Test: Add a console.log("Webpack is working!") to your entry point file to make sure you are running webpack correctly.

Phase 2: MovingObject and Asteroid
MovingObject
Write a MovingObject class in src/moving_object.js.

Store key instance variables:

2D position.
2D velocity.
radius (everything in the game is a circle).
color
Rather than pass all these as separate arguments, write your MovingObject constructor function so that you can pass in an options object:

const mo = new MovingObject({
  pos: [30, 30],
  vel: [10, 10],
  radius: 5,
  color: "#00FF00"
});
Test: Verify that your MovingObject constructor works as expected. In order to access your MovingObject constructor in your browser's console you will need to first export it using module.exports, then require moving_object.js in your entry file, then declare the constructor function on the window. Look at the snippets below as a guide and then make sure you can create a MovingObject in your console!

// moving_object.js
function MovingObject() {
  // your code
}

module.exports = MovingObject;
// index.js
const MovingObject = require("./moving_object.js");

window.MovingObject = MovingObject;
Write a MovingObect.prototype.draw(ctx) method. Draw a circle of the appropriate radius centered at pos. Fill it with the appropriate color. Refer to the Drunken Circles demo if you need a refresher on Canvas.

In the index.js, add an event listener for the DOMContentLoaded event. Within the callback, use document.getElementById() to find the canvas element. Call getContext on the canvas element with "2d" as the argument to extract a canvas context. Now that you're using a DOMContentLoaded callback you can safely move your main.js script tag in index.html into the <head> where it belongs.

Test: Make sure you can draw a MovingObject.

Write a MovingObject.prototype.move method. Increment the pos by the vel.

Util
We want to allow our classes to inherit from another. We could monkey-patch Function to add an inherits method:

Function.prototype.inherits = function (ParentClass) { ... };
However, monkey-patching can cause problems and should be done judiciously. Instead, let's create a general utilities module in src/util.js and add our first utility function to it as Util.inherits = function (childClass, parentClass) { ... }.

Note: You should export a POJO (plain old JavaScript object) from Util, not a class or constructor function. We don't need to create instances of Util.

const Util = {
  inherits(childClass, parentClass) {
    //...
  }
};

module.exports = Util;
Below is the same above, but written with ES6 for cleaner syntax.

const Util = {
  inherits: function inherits(childClass, parentClass) {
    //...
  }
};

module.exports = Util;
Asteroid
Write an Asteroid class in a src/asteroid.js file. This should inherit from MovingObject.

Pick a default COLOR and RADIUS for Asteroids. Set these as properties of the Asteroid class: Asteroid.COLOR and Asteroid.RADIUS.

Write your Asteroid constructor so that the caller specifies the pos and calls the MovingObject superconstructor, setting color and radius to the Asteroid defaults, and choosing a random vector for vel. Use the following helper functions from the Util object to help you create a random vector.

// Return a randomly oriented vector with the given length.
const Util = {
  randomVec(length) {
    const deg = 2 * Math.PI * Math.random();
    return Util.scale([Math.sin(deg), Math.cos(deg)], length);
  },
  // Scale the length of a vector by the given amount.
  scale(vec, m) {
    return [vec[0] * m, vec[1] * m];
  }
};
// Other properties are filled in for you.
new Asteroid({ pos: [30, 30] });
Why do we still need to call MovingObject's constructor function from within Asteroid's constructor function?

Our inherits function sets up the prototype inheritance chain, which makes methods available on the parent's prototype available to instances of the child class. However, we still need to call MovingObject's constructor function from within Asteroid's constructor function to access the code that sets properties such as this.pos and this.vel. Its the equivalent to calling super in a class's #initialize method in Ruby.

Note: Invoking an ES2015 class constructor without new (such as MovingObject with call()) throws an error. Hence the need to use ES5 syntax for this project.

Test: Make sure you can create and draw an Asteroid.

Game
Game will be in charge of holding all of our moving objects. It will also contain the logic for iterating through these objects and calling their corresponding move methods.

Write a Game class in src/game.js. Define the following constants on the Game class: DIM_X, DIM_Y, and NUM_ASTEROIDS.

Write a Game.prototype.addAsteroids method. Randomly place the asteroids within the dimensions of the game grid. You may also wish to write a Game.prototype.randomPosition method. Store the asteroids as a property of your game instance in an array asteroids. Call addAsteroids in your constructor.

Write a Game.prototype.draw(ctx) method. It should call clearRect on the ctx to wipe down the entire space. Call the draw method on each of the asteroids.

Write a Game.prototype.moveObjects method. It should call move on each of the asteroids.

GameView
Your GameView class will be responsible for keeping track of the canvas context, the game, and the ship. Your GameView will be in charge of setting an interval to animate your game. In addition, it will eventually bind key handlers to the ship so that we can move it around.

Define an GameView class in src/game_view.js. The GameView should store a Game and take in and store a drawing ctx.

Write a GameView.prototype.start method. It should call setInterval to call Game.prototype.moveObjects and Game.prototype.draw once every 20ms or so.

Back to your entry file
Once you have your GameView set up, construct a GameView object and call GameView.prototype.start within the DOMContentLoaded callback in index.js.

This is your webpack entry point, so restart webpack and make sure everything is working properly.

Your asteroids should fly around :-)

Phase 2a: Wrapping Asteroids
Currently your asteroids slide off the screen. We'd like to keep everything within the dimensions of the game's rectangular view by mapping opposite sides of the grid view. If an asteroid scrolls off one side, it should reappear on the other. Write a Game.prototype.wrap(pos) method, which takes a pos in and returns a "wrapped position".

Next, change your calls of new Asteroid to pass in the game as one of the options. In MovingObject, store the game. Update your MovingObject.prototype.move method to call Game.prototype.wrap on this.pos each time.

Check that your Asteroids don't all fly away, but instead wrap like they are supposed to.

Phase 2b: Colliding Asteroids
A big part of Asteroids is the collision of objects: ships collide with asteroids, bullets collide with asteroids. To start, let's implement asteroids colliding with asteroids.

Write a MovingObject.prototype.isCollidedWith(otherObject) method. Two circles have collided if the distance between their center points is less than the sum of their radii.

Next, write a Game.prototype.checkCollisions that iterates through the asteroids and alert("COLLISION"); whenever two collide. Make sure not to check if an asteroid collides with itself.

Write a Game.prototype.step method, which calls Game.prototype.moveObjects then Game.prototype.checkCollisions. Call this in GameView.prototype.start instead of moveObjects directly.

Check your work. This shouldn't be too hard if you reduce Game.NUM_ASTEROIDS = 4 or so.

Last: when an asteroid crashes into another, let's remove both asteroids. Write Game.prototype.remove(asteroid) and MovingObject.prototype.collideWith(otherObject). In MovingObject.prototype.collideWith(otherObject), call Game.prototype.remove on both objects.

We'll change this soon, but we want to have collision and removal logic working. Check that when two asteroids collide, they both go away.

Phase 3a: Ship
In src/ship.js, write an Ship class; this should be another subclass of MovingObject. Define Ship.RADIUS and Ship.COLOR as before. I default initialize the vel to the zero vector.

In your Game constructor, build a Ship object. I used Game.prototype.randomPosition to place the Ship. Save your ship to an instance variable.

I wrote a Game.prototype.allObjects method that returned the array of Asteroids + the ship. I iterated through this in Game.prototype.draw, Game.prototype.moveObjects, and Game.prototype.checkCollisions

Update the MovingObject.prototype.collideWith(otherObject) logic. Stop removing colliding asteroids; your MovingObject.prototype.collideWith should be empty. Instead, overwrite the superclass's method with Asteroid.prototype.collideWith(otherObject): if otherObject instanceof Ship, call Ship.prototype.relocate. The Ship.prototype.relocate method should reset the Ship's position to game.randomPosition() and reset velocity to the zero vector.

Phase 3b: Moving the ship
Add a Ship.prototype.power(impulse). The impulse should be added to the current velocity of the ship.

Add a GameView.prototype.bindKeyHandlers method. Check out the keymaster library. You should include keymaster.js in your javascripts folder and use a script src tag to require it above your main.js file. The keymaster library will expose a global method key which takes a key and a callback that will be triggered when the key is pressed. Use it to bind keys to call Ship.prototype.power on the game's ship. Call your bindKeyHandlers method in GameView.prototype.start.

Phase 4a: Firing Bullets
Write a Bullet subclass of MovingObject. The idea is that when a collides with an Asteroid, we'll remove the Asteroid from the Game.

The key is Ship.prototype.fireBullet. This should:

Construct a new Bullet instance.
You will want to use the Ships vel as the direction of travel of the bullet.
Add the bullet to an array of Game bullets.
Game should store an array of Bullets just like Asteroids. To make my life easier, I wrote a Game.prototype.add(obj) method that added to this.asteroids/this.bullets if obj instanceof Asteroid/obj instanceof Bullet. I wrote a similar Game.prototype.remove(obj) method. This was easier than having two methods each for Asteroid and Bullet.

Update your Game.prototype.allObjects as well.

Update GameView.prototype.addKeyBindings to bind a key to Ship.prototype.fireBullet.

Phase 5: Cleaning up objects
Your Bullet should not wrap like other objects. When it leaves the visible grid, it should be removed.

Write a Game.prototype.isOutOfBounds(pos) to return true if an object slips off screen.

Define a property MovingObject.prototype.isWrappable = true. However, you can overwrite this in Bullet to be false.

In MovingObject.prototype.move, after updating the position, check if the object is out of bounds. If so, either (A) wrap the object if it isWrappable or (B) call Game.prototype.remove if not.

Phase 6 (Bonus): Drawing an image
Often times people want to draw a background image on their game.

const img = new Image();
img.onload = function() {
  ctx.drawImage(img, xOffset, yOffset);
};
img.src = "myImage.png";
Note you may have to redraw the background each iteration. You do not need to constantly reload the img; just make sure to ctx.drawImage each frame.

Phase 7 (Bonus): RequestAnimationFrame
We are going to have our game use requestAnimationFrame. Go to the console and type this in. Notice that it is the global namespace. It provides a better way to do animations. Read more here.

Phase 7b: MovingObject
Rewrite your move method, this time allowing it to take in a timeDelta. Increment the pos by the vel * delta. The delta will be created in the GameView's animate method based on the time variable provided by window.requestAnimationFrame. Until we define that method, default delta to a value of 1. You can default a value using the logical OR operator delta = delta || 1.

Phase 7c: Game
Refactor your Game.prototype.moveObjects(delta) method. It should the delta to each Asteroid.prototype.move.

Phase 7d: GameView
The GameView should now store a lastTime instance variable. It will be used to derive the delta (default it to 0).

Write a GameView.prototype.animate method. It should:

Create a delta variable. It represents the difference between the last time animate was called and the current call to animate. The current time will be passed to the animate function as a parameter.

Call requestAnimationFrame, passing in the GameView.prototype.animate. Yes, this is recursive. Each frame calls the next.

Call Game.prototype.moveObjects(delta) and Game.prototype.draw(ctx)

Update this.lastTime to be equal to the current time;

Refactor your GameView.prototype.start method. It will make the first call to requestAnimationFrame, passing in the GameView.prototype.animate.

NB: You'll notice that all of your moving objects are moving way too fast. Go back to MovingObject.prototype.move and divide the delta by some number before adding it to the velocity. Your code might look something like:

const velX = (this.vel[0] * delta) / 20;
const velY = (this.vel[1] * delta) / 20;

this.pos = [this.pos[0] + velX, this.pos[1] + velY];
