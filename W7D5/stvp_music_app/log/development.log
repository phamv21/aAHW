AbstractController::DoubleRenderError - Render and/or redirect were called multiple times in this action. Please note that you may only call render OR redirect, and at most once per action. Also note that neither redirect nor render terminate execution of the action, so if you want to exit an action after redirecting, you need to do something like "redirect_to(...) and return".:

Snippets of the track were posted by him on TikTok in September of 2021. \"On the songwriting level, it was really cool to share this song with the fans while I made it,\" the singer noted in a statement at the time, \"So they felt like they were involved at the very beginning of the song, like they almost wrote it with me.\"\r\nAn acoustic version of this track was performed by Charlie Puth live on piano for a TikTok 2021 New Year's Eve stream. The song and its video were officially released on the 20th of January, 2022.\r\nAZLyrics C Charlie Puth Lyrics\r\nYou May Also Like\r\nLauv - \"Chasing Fire\"\r\nI wanna hate you cause I still love you And it's weighing on my chest We keep our bodies tied together To ignore what's coming next I was driving you home in the middle of the night But I couldn't...\r\nJack & Jack - \"Beg\"\r\nSoak you up, wring me out Leave me dry a hundred time just to turn me down Just to turn me down A little time, a little tease A little more of your kiss, what I really need Yeah, I really need, yeah...\r\nJustin Bieber - \"Company\"\r\nCan we, we keep, keep each other company?
