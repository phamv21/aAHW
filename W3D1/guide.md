RSpec Homework
For tonight's homework, we will be implementing some specs for the Dessert class!

Here's what you need to do:

Download the project skeleton
Review the dessert.rb and chef.rb files to see what functionality exists. Do not edit or add any code to these files.
In the dessert_spec.rb file, implement all of the pending specs (the it statements without blocks).
Run your specs and see that they all pass!
Hints:

You should be using mocks for the Chef class - don't make actual instances of the Chef class! We want to isolate and test the behavior of the Dessert class on its own. If you get stuck, revisit the reading on creating mocks/doubles. The chef double has already been created for you, but you will need to add to it!

Note: Technically, this is not Test Driven Development since we've provided the Dessert class for you. That's okay! The idea for tonight's homework is to familiarize you with RSpec syntax and methods. Enjoy your dessert!
